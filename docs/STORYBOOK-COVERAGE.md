# Storybook Component Coverage

This document tracks the progress of creating Storybook stories for all components in the application as part of the **UI & Interaction Epic**. Our goal is to have comprehensive Storybook coverage, which helps us build a robust, testable, and well-documented component library.

## Component Checklist

The components are grouped by their general function and complexity.

### Phase 1: Foundational (Atomic) Components

These are the basic, reusable building blocks of our UI.

| Status | Component                | Path                                       | Notes                               |
| :----: | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
